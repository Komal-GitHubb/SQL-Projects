Some customers eventually upgraded to higher-tier plans (pro monthly/annual).
Churn occurred for a few customers after 2-3 months of subscribing to the basic monthly plan.
  
These patterns suggest a common trend of initially offering a trial period, followed by a transition to basic plans, with few customers further upgrading or eventually churning after a few months.
