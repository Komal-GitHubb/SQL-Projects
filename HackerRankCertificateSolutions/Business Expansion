As part of business expansion efforts at a company, your help is needed to find all pairs of customers and agents who have been in contact more than once.
For each such pair, display the user_id, first_name, and last name, and the customer id, name, and the number of their contacts.
Order the result by user id ascending.

CODE:

with t as (select user_account_id, customer_id, count(*) as c from contact
group by 1,2
having count(*)>1),
user as
(select distinct u.id as user_id, first_name, last_name
 from user_account u
join contact c on u.id= c.user_account_id
where u.id in (select user_account_id from t)),
cus AS
(select distinct cus.id as cus_id, customer_name, c
 from customer cus
join contact c on cus.id= c.customer_id
join t on cus.id=t.customer_id
where cus.id in (select customer_id from t))


select user_id, first_name, last_name, cus_id, customer_name, c from user,cus
